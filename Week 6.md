## Summary
This week, significant progress was made in modifying and editing the supercapacitor model based on the existing MATLAB model and the specific requirements from RoboMaster regarding the capacitor. The objective is to ensure the supercapacitor meets the necessary specifications for controlling the robot's output power to 40W using a four-switch bidirectional Buck-Boost topology.

1. **Review of Existing MATLAB Model**
   - Conducted a thorough review of the current MATLAB model of the supercapacitor.
   - Tried to find the key parameters and areas requiring modification to meet the RoboMaster specifications.

2. **Modification of Supercapacitor Parameters**
   - Adjusted the capacitance, internal resistance, and other relevant parameters in the MATLAB model.
   - Ensured the modifications align with the power requirements and performance criteria specified by RoboMaster.
