# Weekly Report --Week 4

## Project Overview
This project involves the integration and control of a supercapacitor with a battery to efficiently manage energy storage and supply. The goal is to control the output power to 40W using a supercapacitor and a four-switch bidirectional Buck-Boost topology. The system also includes a DC-DC bidirectional converter for managing the energy flow between the supercapacitor, battery, and load.

## System Model Analysis

### Supercapacitor and Battery Integration
- **Integration**: The system integrates a supercapacitor (supercap) with a battery (bat1) to optimize energy storage and power supply.
- **Connection**: The supercapacitor is connected to the system via a DC-DC bidirectional converter, allowing for bidirectional energy transfer.
- **Monitoring**: Voltage and current from both the supercapacitor and the battery are continuously monitored to ensure balanced power distribution, enhancing the efficiency and lifespan of both energy storage components.

### Control Systems
- **Core Component**: The control block is a critical part of the system, responsible for managing the energy flow between the supercapacitor, battery, and the load.
- **Buck-Boost Circuit**: The control system utilizes a buck-boost circuit with two MOSFETs to regulate the energy transfer. This enables the system to step up or step down the voltage as needed, ensuring stable power delivery.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: The control block adjusts energy flow based on real-time data from the supercapacitor and battery, maintaining optimal performance and preventing overcharging or deep discharge of the supercapacitor.

### Power Load Management
- **DC/AC Converter**: The system includes a DC/AC converter to manage AC loads, expanding its application range.
- **Consistent Output**: Power load is closely monitored and controlled to maintain a consistent output of 40W, regardless of variations in input or load conditions.
- **Feedback Loops**: Integrated feedback loops dynamically adjust the power output, ensuring it remains within the desired range. This real-time adjustment helps in mitigating any potential fluctuations in power supply.

## Still meet some problems
-**Do not understand the transfer functions' meaning.
-**How to define the "Ts" ?

### Next step
